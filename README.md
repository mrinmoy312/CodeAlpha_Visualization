# CodeAlpha - Task 3: Data Visualization

**Intern Name**: Mrinmoy Jana  
**Domain**: Data Analytics  
**Organization**: CodeAlpha  
**Task**: Task 3 - Data Visualization using Python

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this task is to transform raw structured data into meaningful visual formats such as charts and graphs using Python libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib. By designing intuitive visualizations, this project aims to reveal hidden patterns and trends in the dataset and enhance data-driven understanding.


---

## 📊 Dataset Used

- **Source**: Seaborn's built-in `tips` dataset
- **Description**: Data about restaurant bills, tips, customer gender, time, smoker status, etc.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

---

## 📈 Visualizations Created

1. **Bar Plot** – Average tip by day  
2. **Line Plot** – Tip vs. Total Bill  
3. **Pie Chart** – Gender Distribution  
4. **Heatmap** – Feature Correlation Matrix  
5. **Box Plot** – Tip distribution by gender  

Each visualization helps to identify patterns in customer behavior and tipping trends based on day, gender, and bill size.
